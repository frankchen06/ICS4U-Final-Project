This project is a modern, online adaptation of the classic Guess Who game, developed primarily in Java using the Eclipse IDE.

It features advanced functionality powered by data structures and algorithms, including an AI opponent that uses logical reasoning and analysis of player input to strategically guess the playerâ€™s character. The AI difficulty is adjustable, allowing users to choose between easier and more challenging gameplay.

The project leverages the object-oriented capabilities of Java, with a strong emphasis on OOP principles such as inheritance, abstract classes, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

A user-friendly graphical interface was developed using the Java Swing framework, enabling smooth and intuitive interaction with the game.
